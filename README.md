# Sparse linear assignment

Solvers for weighted perfect matching problem ([linear assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem)) for bipartite graphs. Both solvers use variants of auction algorithm and implemented in Rust.

   * **KhoslaSolver** is best suited for asymmetric k-regular sparse graphs. The algorithm is presented in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07155.pdf). It stops in finite number of iterations.
   * **ForwardAuctionSolver** works better for symmetric assignment problems. It uses Îµ-scaling to speedup the auction algorithm. The implementation is based on [sslap](https://github.com/OllieBoyne/sslap). When there is no perfect matching it enters in endless loop and stops after `max_iterations` number of iterations.

## Usage
See [tests](./src/solver.rs#L261) for example usage.
